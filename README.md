# üèò Prodigy-ANN

![](images/approach.png)

This repository contains a Prodigy plugin for recipes that involve approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) techniques to fetch relevant subsets of the data to curate. To encode the text this library uses
[sentence-transformers](https://sbert.org) and it uses
[hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) as an index for these vectors.

You can install this plugin via `pip`. 

```
pip install "prodigy-ann @ git+https://github.com/explosion/prodigy-ann"
```

To learn more about this plugin, you can check the [Prodigy docs](https://prodi.gy/docs/plugins/#ann).
